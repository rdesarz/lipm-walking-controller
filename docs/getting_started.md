# Getting started

Docker is recommended to run the examples. You simply need to download the docker image associated with the project:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/rdesarz/biped-walking-controller/biped-walking-controller:latest
```

You can then run several examples described in each section:

* [Example 1: preview controller](preview_control.md#example)
* [Example 2: foot trajectory generation](foot.md#example)
* [Example 3: inverse kinematics](inverse_kinematics.md#example)
* [Example 4: preview controller](simulation.md#example)
