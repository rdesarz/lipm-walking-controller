# Getting started

Docker is recommended to run the examples. Here are the commands that you need to setup the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rdesarz/biped-walking-controller.git
cd biped-walking-controller
docker build -t biped-walking-controller .
```

You can then run several examples described in each section:

* [Example 1: preview controller](preview_control.md#example)
* [Example 2: foot trajectory generation](foot.md#example)
* [Example 3: inverse kinematics](inverse_kinematics.md#example)
* [Example 4: preview controller](simulation.md#example)
